          <h3>Effects on Marine Life</h3>
          <p>The pH level of oceans have been measurably lower since one hundred years ago. The lower the pH level is, the more acidic the water is. Much of ocean life cannot survive in these acidic conditions. Most of the coral reefs throughout the world have died and this has led to the diversity of our oceans dropping due to the ecosystems built around coral reefs disappearing. While many fish and smaller animals have gone extinct or are going extinct. Animals that people are more familiar with that are going extinct include; polar bears, seals, sea lions, walrus, and the green sea turtle. </p>

          <h3>Effects on Human Life</h3>
          <p>Our factories, cars and much of our technology produces huge amounts of carbon dioxide that is trapping more heat in our world. Over a billion people rely on the ocean for food. On top of that, the coral that humans are destroying is responsible for many of the drugs we create to treat cancer and other diseases. While a billion people are relying on oceans directly, all humankind relies on oceans indirectly. The ocean is responsible for absorbing 93% of the Carbon that we release into our atmosphere. However, at some point the oceans will be at capacity for how much carbon it can absorb. As we continue to approach that point, our way of life will lower in quality. wildlife that we depend on will go extinct and it is possible that the destruction of our oceans will be the destruction of ourselves.
              Climate change will increase at an exponential rate as we destroy our oceans. We will lose plant life, photosynthesis will decrease and rates of carbon dioxide conversion to oxygen will continue to decrease.</p>

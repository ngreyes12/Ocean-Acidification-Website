        <div class="col mt-5"><p>Due to our extreme increase of carbon emissions into the atmosphere, humans have caused irreversible damage to the oceans. As previously mentioned, over 90% of carbon emissions are absorbed by the oceans. Not just have we increased carbon emissions, but we have severely decreased the amount of trees that are meant to take the carbon out of our air and put it back into the ground. Fossil fuels are pulling carbon out of the ground and putting it into the air at a rate that is not sustainable. However, while much of humankind is aware this is a problem, countries have been slow to respond. </p></div>
